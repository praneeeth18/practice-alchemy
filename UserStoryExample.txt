A project is split into several small parts called Epics, which are further broken into smaller units, and these units are called user stories

In a real-time project, user stories are typically written collaboratively by the development team, product owners, 
and stakeholders during the planning phase.

Steps: 
Identify Users and Roles
Define User Goals
Write User Stories
Prioritize User Stories
Estimate User Stories
Refine and Iterate
Track Progress

By following these steps, development teams can effectively capture and prioritize user requirements,
leading to the successful delivery of products and systems that meet user needs and expectations.

User Acceptance criteria:

User acceptance criteria is a set of conditions or criteria that must be met in order for a user story, feature, 
or deliverable to be accepted by the end user or customer. They are defined collaboratively by the development team, product owner, and stakeholders
during the sprint or iteration planning process in Agile development.

User acceptance criteria help to ensure that the work delivered meets the expectations and requirements of the users or customers. They serve as objective
measures of success and provide clarity on what constitutes a satisfactory outcome. By defining acceptance criteria upfront, the team can focus their
efforts on meeting specific goals and delivering value to the users.

Here are some key characteristics of user acceptance criteria:

Specific: UAC should be clear, concise, and specific, leaving no room for ambiguity.
They should articulate exactly what needs to be accomplished or demonstrated.

Measurable: UAC should be measurable and verifiable. They should describe observable outcomes or behaviors that can be objectively assessed.

Achievable: UAC should be realistic and attainable within the given constraints, such as time, resources, and technology.

Relevant: UAC should be relevant to the user's needs and aligned with the overall goals of the project.
They should focus on delivering value to the end user or customer.

Time-bound: UAC should be time-bound, meaning they should specify when the criteria need to be met, such as by the end of a sprint or before a certain
deadline.

Independent: Each user story should have its own set of acceptance criteria that are independent of other stories.
This ensures that each feature or deliverable can be evaluated on its own merits.

Example:

Format: As a (particular user), I want to (accomplish this task) so that I can (achieve this objective or goal). 

User Story: As a registered user, I want to be able to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget my password.

User Acceptance Criteria:

The "Forgot Password" link is prominently displayed on the login page.
Clicking on the "Forgot Password" link takes the user to a password reset page.
The password reset page includes a form where the user can enter their email address.
After submitting the email address, the user receives an email with a password reset link.
Clicking on the password reset link takes the user to a page where they can enter a new password.
After entering a new password, the user is redirected to the login page with a success message confirming that their password has been reset.


User story:
"As a commuter, I want to be able to check real-time bus arrival times on my phone so that I can plan my journey more efficiently."

This user story captures the perspective of a commuter who relies on public transportation. It articulates the user's need to access real-time bus arrival
information conveniently through a mobile device. By fulfilling this user story, the product or service being developed would provide value to users by
helping them plan their journeys more effectively and reduce waiting times at bus stops.

User Acceptance criteria:

The mobile application should provide a clear and intuitive interface for accessing real-time bus arrival information.
The application should display accurate and up-to-date arrival times for nearby bus stops based on the user's current location.
Bus arrival times should be refreshed automatically at regular intervals to ensure that users have access to the latest information.
